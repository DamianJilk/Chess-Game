# Chess_Game
Simulates a chess game. Currently under development

Recent changes:
- When selecting a chess piece, all possible moves are displayed
- Possible moves that need to be implemented yet:
     --> restricting moves when king is in check
     --> restricting moves when a move would cause the king to be in check
     --> castling
- En passant possible moves
- King in check is under development -- does not keep color indicator when king is in check after piece is selected

Future Work:
- Finish possible moves
- Add clock
- Randomize the color (right now, white is always the user)
- Create AI 1.0 --> makes random moves
- Create AI 2.0 --> better than me (ELO ~ 1000)
